# Big Data Final Project
## Mental Health Discussion on Twitter

### Todo:
- Sentiment analysis on tweet text
    - already preprocessed
- Make graphs look nice
- group related terms
- filter out non MH related tweets (ie tropical depression)


### Observations
- client.persist/compute vs df.persist
    - client seems faster
    - does it not use all cores when df.
